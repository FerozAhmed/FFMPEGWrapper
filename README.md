About
=====
A very small .NET library that wraps the FFMPEG command-line executable in an
easy to use C# wrapper.

    
Pre-requisites
==============
.NET 4.0 - but it will probably work fine on 2.0 as well if you want to try it

Using FFMPEGWrapper
=====================
1. Open up the Visual Studio 2010 solution.
2. Build and execute the FFMPEGHarness project, it will execute a few
   demonstration functions, e.g. resizing a video, watermarking a video.

Support
=========
Absolutely none provided.
